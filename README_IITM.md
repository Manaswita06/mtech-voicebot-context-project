# Context Extraction and Reuse from Voicebot Transcripts

## Overview
This project addresses the problem of fragmented customer interactions in automated voice systems by extracting and reusing conversational context from historical voicebot transcripts. The work aims to enable continuity across multiple interactions and channels while improving conversational understanding and customer experience.

## Objectives
- Extract conversational signals such as intent, entities, sentiment, and conversation state
- Model session-level and customer-level conversational context
- Store and retrieve context for reuse in subsequent interactions
- Evaluate the effectiveness of context-aware conversational models

## Scope
- Use of publicly available or synthetically generated voicebot transcripts
- Application of NLP and machine learning techniques for context extraction
- Design of structured schemas for conversational context
- Comparative evaluation against stateless conversational approaches

## Methodology
The project involves data preprocessing, NLP-based context extraction, structured context modeling, storage and retrieval mechanisms, and experimental evaluation to assess the impact of context reuse.

## Tools and Technologies
Python, spaCy, HuggingFace Transformers, scikit-learn, SQLite/PostgreSQL.

## Compliance Statement
No proprietary or confidential data is used. The project is developed and executed entirely on a personal system using anonymized or synthetic datasets, in compliance with organizational and academic guidelines.
